Our applications will help the doctors to easily find the fracture in the bone. We choose this domain because fracture often occurs in human bone due to accident injuries, it also consumes more time for fresher to detect the fracture in the bone, this may result in delay of treatment. For this we designing the system which takes x-ray bone image as the input and determine whether the bone fractured or not. We are doing this by using Convelutional neural network, where the features are extracted and helps in classifying the image as fractured or not. And also we use Contours technique to locate the fracture in the image.
